            7 Ways U.S. States are Setting the Stage for Climate Action
          </h1>
          <p>
            Although the American people may appear to be divided, but when it
            comes to preserving the environment, 25 governors have banded
            together to support the Paris Agreement on climate change.<br />
            The governors of California, Washington, and New York came out in
            support of the Paris Agreement five years ago on June 1, 2017, when
            the Trump administration declared its intention to leave the accord.
            Since that time, the U.S. Climate Alliance has expanded to include
            24 states as well as Puerto Rico. Moreover, it keeps on enlarging.

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row mx-3">
        <div class="col-12">
          <p>
            The governors of the alliance, who represent a diverse range of
            people, places, and economies, are brought together by a shared
            goal: to demonstrate that states can take the lead on climate action
            while boosting clean energy economies, enhancing public health, and
            constructing more resilient communities. <br />The U.S. Climate
            Alliance currently represents 60% of the country's GDP, 40% of its
            greenhouse gas emissions, and 55% of its population. The alliance
            would have the third-largest economy in the world after the United
            States and China, if it were a nation. These states have been
            implementing climate change leadership over the past five years
            because they understand that it cannot wait.<br /><br />
            The U.S. Climate Alliance's member states have taken the following
            seven significant climate change-related actions:<br />
            1. Set challenging targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Every
            state that joins the Alliance commits to enacting laws that advance
            the Paris Agreement's objectives, which call for at least a 26-28%
            decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2025, while
            many are pressing for much greater cuts. For instance, the state of
            California set a goal for itself to become carbon neutral by 2045.
            The state of New Mexico set the target of lowering GHG emissions by
            45% below 2005 levels by 2030.
            <br />2. A law was signed to promote renewable energy. The
            alliance's member states are advancing the green economy, which is
            crucial for lowering pollution and generating jobs. A law was
            established in Nevada requiring it to obtain 50% of its electricity
            from renewable sources by 2030. In addition, the governor and
            lieutenant governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz and Peggy Flanagan,
            unveiled a new set of policy recommendations that will see Minnesota
            achieve 100% renewable energy in its electrical sector by 2050.<br />
            3. Advocated for increased energy effectiveness. Energy efficiency
            is a key component of any state's climate change strategy because it
            accounts for 40% of all energy use in homes and commercial buildings
            in the United States. A groundbreaking norm that will enhance the
            energy efficiency of thousands of major commercial buildings around
            the state was established by legislation that Governor Jay Inslee of
            Washington state signed into law.
            <br />4. Policies for Zero Emission Vehicles are being accelerated.
            The greatest source of emissions in the transportation industry,
            passenger vehicles, are being reduced at a faster rate than any
            other state in the alliance. The Colorado Air Quality Control
            Commission unanimously decided to start the process of requiring
            automakers to produce 5% of their vehicles for sale in Colorado as
            electric vehicles by the year 2023 in May 2019. A bill that offers
            subsidies to those who install new electric vehicle charging
            stations or improve current ones was passed by the legislature of
            Hawaii.<br />5. Regulations to reduce dangerous air pollutants.
            While carbon dioxide pollution receives the majority of attention,
            other short-lived climate pollutants including black carbon,
            methane, and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) also pose serious threats to
            the environment and human health. Plans to reduce methane leaks from
            landfills and natural gas infrastructure were made public by
            Virginia in 2019. With the intention of preventing federal rollbacks
            and outlawing the use of dangerous HFCs, Connecticut, Maryland, and
            New York plan to introduce restrictions in 2019. Washington and
            Vermont have also recently enacted legislation along these lines.
            <br />6. Developed fresh finance options for resilient communities
            and renewable energy. Governor Charlie Baker of Massachusetts has
            authorized nearly $2.4 billion in investments to protect people,
            communities, and businesses from the effects of climate change, as
            well as to maintain the environment and enhance recreational
            possibilities. Additionally, Colorado established a new "Green Bank"
            to use private funding as leverage to encourage investment in clean
            energy projects.<br />7. Created unique resources and tools to
            assist the state in addressing climate change. State governments
            require specialized tools and resources in order to monitor their
            climate action efforts and evaluate the risks from consequences. For
            instance, Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina published the
            state's greenhouse gas inventory, which keeps track of current
            emissions and forecasts future ones. To assist North Carolina's
            coastal towns in coping with problems brought on by climate impacts,
            such as rising sea levels, the state also launched a new website
            called Coastal Adaptation and Resiliency. <br /><br />The
            above-listed initiatives only represent a small portion of the
            state-level climate action taking place. Additionally, regional and
            local efforts at the county and city levels continue to advance
            efforts to combat climate change across the United States. In the
            end, increased action from everyone, everywhere, and at all levels
            is necessary to address the global climate crisis. "Climate change
            is a race we can win, but we must scale up ambition now," said
            United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres.
